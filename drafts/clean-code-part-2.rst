Clean Code - Part 2
===================

Write Stateless Code
--------------------

    A **pure function** is a **function** where the return value is only
    determined by its input values, without observable side effects. This is
    how **functions** in math work: ``Math.cos(x)`` will, for the same value
    of ``x``, always return the same result.

Write Readable Code
-------------------

    In computer science, the **expressive power** (also called
    **expressiveness** or expressivity) of a language is the breadth of ideas
    that can be represented and communicated in that language [...]

    - regardless of ease (theoretical expressivity)
    - **concisely and readily** (practical expressivity)
