<h1>Data Engineering on Azure RTM</h1>
<p>My book, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.manning.com/books/data-engineering-on-azure">Data Engineering on Azure</a>,
which I announced in <a class="reference external" href="https://vladris.com/blog/2020/10/08/azure-data-engineering.html">this blog post</a>,
is going to print soon. As I did with my previous book, <a class="reference external" href="https://vladris.com/blog/2019/10/16/programming-with-types-rtm.html">Programming with Types</a>,
I’m writing another “RTM” post to talk about a few aspects of the process.</p>
<div class="section" id="title-evolution">
<h2>Title evolution</h2>
<p>When I pitched the book to Manning, I used the title <em>Production Data Engineering
with Azure</em>. The title was supposed to capture that this is a book about the
practical aspects of data engineering, with examples on the Azure platform. In
fact, here is how I described the book’s topic in the proposal:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The same way Software Engineering brings engineering rigor to software
development, Data Engineering aims to bring rigor to working with data in a
reliable way.</p>
<p>This book is about implementing the various aspects of a big data platform –
data ingestion, running analytics and ML, distributing data – in a real-world
production system. The focus is on operational aspects like DevOps, monitoring,
scale, and compliance. Examples will be provided using Azure services.</p>
<p>There is a big gap between what it takes, for example, to implement an ML model
in Python and what it takes to run in a production environment, on a regular
basis, with robust guardrails in place. The book focuses on the latter, which
makes it different than other data platform books.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The Manning team has a lot of experience putting together books (and selling
them). We iterated on the title quite a few times, trying to best capture the
essence of the book. Once we started the project, we changed the name from
<em>Production Data Engineering with Azure</em> to <em>Practical Data Engineering on Azure</em>.</p>
<p>Before launching the book as a Manning Early Access Preview (MEAP), we changed
the name again, this time to <em>Azure Data Engineering</em>: the “Practical” part of the
title made it a bit too long and not very clear.</p>
<p>As the manuscript was wrapping up, we took another look at the title: <em>Azure Data
Engineering</em> implies the book is Azure-specific. While all the examples provided
are built in the Azure cloud, my hope is the patterns and ideas discussed apply
to any big data platform, in any cloud. We iterated on the title again, to
emphasize the “data engineering” part, and ended up with <em>Data Engineering on
Azure</em>. This is the final title of the book.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="articles-and-excerpts">
<h2>Articles and excerpts</h2>
<p>Before starting the project, I wrote a few articles on the topic. The first
one was <a class="reference external" href="https://vladris.com/blog/2019/12/08/notes-on-data-engineering.html">Notes on Data Engineering</a>.
Soon after, my team launched the <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft">Data Science &#64; Microsoft</a>
Medium publication, where I contributed several articles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/how-we-built-self-serve-data-environment-tools-with-azure-3951a698fc9d">How we built self-serve data environment tools with Azure</a>.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/azure-data-explorer-at-the-azure-business-scale-89262ef8c1fd">Azure Data Explorer at the Azure business scale</a>.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/running-machine-learning-at-scale-808b90f0ec75">Running machine learning at scale</a>.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/common-data-engineering-challenges-and-their-solution-dd51872812ac">Common data engineering challenges and their solution</a> - which is a retake on that first article (Notes on Data Engineering).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/partnering-for-data-quality-dc9123557f8b">Partnering for data quality</a>.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/partnering-for-metadata-management-277733911d03">Partnering for metadata management</a>.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/data-distribution-9085b4316591">Data distribution</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the ideas from these articles show up in the book. While the articles
talk about the specific challenges my team encountered and the solutions we came
up with to solve them, the book covers patterns - the general types of problems
you would encounter while building a big data platform, and solutions you could
apply. The articles helped me to clarify (for myself) the topics I wanted to
cover in the book, and refine the proposed solutions.</p>
<p>Once the manuscript was well underway, I wrote a blog post on <a class="reference external" href="https://vladris.com/blog/2020/11/13/data-quality-testing-patterns.html">Data Quality Testing Patterns</a>
to clarify my thoughts as I was working on chapter 9 (Data quality), but
otherwise switched my focus from articles to getting the book done. At this
point, I started publishing excerpts from the book. So far I wrote about
<a class="reference external" href="https://vladris.com/blog/2020/11/27/changing-data-classification-through-processing.html">Changing data classification through processing</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://vladris.com/blog/2021/03/12/ingesting-data.html">Ingesting data</a>,
with more to come.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-speed-of-the-cloud">
<h2>The speed of the cloud</h2>
<p>Innovation in cloud computing moves at a break-neck speed. The technology
changes so fast, it is hard to pin things down in written form. For setting up
various Azure services, I wanted to rely on command line scripts instead of the
Azure Portal UI - walking readers through series of screenshots is tedious, and
UI changes all the time. I used <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/">Azure CLI</a>
instead. That said, many of the extensions I used throughout the book are
currently “experimental”, which means they might change at a future time. I
also found a couple of bugs I reported to the teams maintaining the Azure CLI
extensions.</p>
<p>Another example of the speed of innovation is <a class="reference external" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/purview/">Azure Purview</a>.
When I started working on our data platform, there was no Azure Purview and my
team had to develop a home-grown solution to address our data inventory needs.
We then got to use a preview, in-development version of Azure Purview before it
was publicly announced (one of the perks of working at Microsoft). Chapter 8 of
my book covers metadata management, with the reference implementation on Azure
Purview. That meant I wasn’t able to start on this chapter until Azure Purview
was officially announced, even though I knew what I wanted to write about.
Things lined up pretty well, I finished chapter 7 and had to skip to chapter 9,
but as I was working on that, Azure Purview went into public preview.</p>
<p>This was a very interesting experience, very different than my previous book.
Writing my first book, I didn’t feel like there were so many moving parts to
get a handle on and the speed with which things changed wasn’t overwhelming.
Even so, I’m confident the patterns I cover in the book will remain the same
for quite some time, regardless of the technologies used to implement them. So
even as new services launch and the ways we interact with the cloud evolve,
the key takeaways should stay relevant.</p>
