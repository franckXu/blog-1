<h1>Time and Complexity</h1>
<p>2020 being a leap year, it’s a good opportunity to talk about how we track
time. We’ll start with that, but this post is as a reflection on the inherent
complexity of the physical world and human societies.</p>
<p>There is a famous blog post, <a class="reference external" href="https://infiniteundo.com/post/25326999628/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time">Falsehoods programmers believe about time</a>,
which covers some well known pitfalls like <em>years have 365 days</em> or
<em>February is always 28 days long</em>. Unfortunately, a lot of software has such
assumptions hardcoded and things go awry.</p>
<p>But before talking about software, let’s step back and look at how we measure
time.</p>
<div class="section" id="atomic-clocks">
<h2>Atomic Clocks</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_clock">Atomic clocks</a> provide an
extremely precise measure of the passage of time. These clock don’t gain or
lose a single second over hundreds of millions of years. These devices are
beautiful: they can provide a monotonic count of the passage of time with an
incredible precision.</p>
<p>In fact, we have the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time">International Atomic Time</a> standard, or TAI,
which is defined, according to Wikipedia, by the weighted average of 400
atomic clocks from over 50 laboratories across the world. This is an
extremely precise measure of time passing on Earth.</p>
<p>It is also not practical enough to be used as the basis of our calendars.
Even with a very accurate, high-resolution, atomic clock, we still need to
account for the fact that the Earth orbits around the Sun (so we get
seasons), and spins around its axis (so we get day and night). Let’s see why
there isn’t a simple mathematical function from atomic clock tick to
year-month-day-hour-minute-second.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="leap-years">
<h2>Leap Years</h2>
<p>Leap years were introduced to account for the fact that Earth’s orbit around
the Sun is slightly longer than exactly 365 days. Without adjusting for this
fact, the seasons would gradually shift around the calendar. But a leap year
doesn’t necessarily occur every 4 years. Turns out Earth’s orbit is slightly
smaller than 365 days and 6 hours, so adding one day every 4 years would
cause seasons to drift the opposite direction. The leap year rule is actually</p>
<blockquote>
<div>A leap year is every year divisible by 4, except for years divisible by
100, unless they are also divisible by 400.</div></blockquote>
<p>So years like 2020, 2024, 2028 and so on are leap years. But years like 1700,
1800, 1900, are <em>not</em> leap years, because they are divisible by 100. Except
1600, and 2000, which are not only divisible by 100, but also by 400.</p>
<p>We started with a simple model of a precise, monotonic atomic clock measuring
ticks, but when get to user-friendly time, we end up with complex business
rules that aim to account for the physical world. But it gets more
complicated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="leap-seconds-and-standards">
<h2>Leap Seconds and Standards</h2>
<p>If leap years were all there is to it, we could’ve easily mapped an atomic
clock tick to a precise date time value. But it gets more complicated. Turns
out Earth’s rotation is not constant - it is irregular, and trends towards
slow down. Major earthquakes can affect the momentum of the rotation. Tidal
interaction with the moon is also slowing down the speed of rotation over
millions of years.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Time">UT1</a>, the Universal Time
standard based on Earth’s rotation, is drifting from the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">UTC</a>, the Coordinated
Universal Time, which uses atomic clocks to measure time. Because of this,
UTC had to introduce leap seconds. A leap second aims to bring UTC time
(based on atomic clock measurements) back in sync with UT1 time (time as
observed astronomically), so they are not more than 1 second apart.</p>
<p>A leap second adds one second to a day, so we end up with a 61 seconds-long
minute. Leap seconds are usually added at the end of the month, UTC time. For
example, on June 30th 2015, the UTC time was, at some point, 23:59:60. This
effectively makes a day 1 second longer.</p>
<p>There is no formula for this: as we measure time both astronomically and
atomically, a standards body decides when a leap second is introduced and
notifies the world every 6 months. In fact, the standard UTC time we use is,
as of the time of this writing, 37 seconds behind the TAI.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-requirements">
<h2>Other Requirements</h2>
<p>Besides the physical realities of measuring time atomically and
astronomically, we have multiple other requirements.</p>
<p>We have daylight saving time, which moves the clocks forward 1 hour in spring
and 1 hour backward in the fall. This creates a 23 hour-long day in the
spring and a 25 hour-long day in the fall (falsehood programmers believe
about time: <em>all days have 24 hours</em>). This is also not standard across the
world: some countries observe daylight saving while others don’t.</p>
<p>We have time zones, which don’t neatly divide the earth in 24 equal-width
slices, rather are set at geopolitical boundaries. Time zones aren’t even
necessarily multiples of 1 hour: India is 5 hour and 30 minutes ahead of UTC.</p>
<p>Also note that daylight saving and time zones get updated: Russia recently
stopped observing daylight saving while China went from 5 different time
zones to a single one, even though its geography hasn’t changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="inherent-complexity">
<h2>Inherent Complexity</h2>
<p>Even with an exact atomic clock, when taking into account year length and day
and night cycles, we have to introduce additional rules to determine the date
and time, like leap years and daylight saving. Not only that, international
standards bodies determine when leap seconds occur, while countries are free
to decide which time zone or time zones they are using.</p>
<p>I believe this is typical of any non-trivial problem space we tackle with
software. When we try to model the physical world, things get messy. They get
messier with humans in the system: laws, standards, and expectations
introduce other arbitrary rules. Software needs to be complex to handle the
real world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="accidental-complexity">
<h2>Accidental Complexity</h2>
<p>The above conclusion might seem to stand against pretty much everything I
wrote on this blog, where I try to argue for clean and simple code. Why
bother if any real world piece of software is destined to grow complex? The
reason is that there is enough complexity inherent in dealing with the real
world, without us having to introduce more. We don’t need to make things
worse than they are. To quote a couple of lines from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">The Zen of Python</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Simple is better than complex.</p>
<p>Complex is better than complicated.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We try to keep things simple. Sometime simple is not enough, we need complex
solutions to complex problems. But at least let’s not make them complicated.
A clean, well-crafted system, with rules properly encapsulated can still be
fairly easy to work with. If developers introduce additional complexity which
stems not from the problem domain but from coding practices, then the ability
to reason about and maintain the system drops precipitously. This is called
<em>accidental complexity</em>.</p>
<p>We should always ask ourselves whether the complexity we are dealing with is
inherent or accidental. The former is unavoidable, the latter should be
avoided at all cost.</p>
